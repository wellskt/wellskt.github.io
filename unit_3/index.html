		<h4>My Unit 3 Issues: </h4>
		<p>I'm having a hard time getting the nav and slogan styled the way I'd like them to be.  I've been playing around w/ style.css for a awhile, and I think I just don't know enough yet.  Going to move on and come back to it later. </p>
		<p>For example, how do I use CSS to get rid of the underlines in the nav links? And to further style them?  Should I be using IDs or Classes or both? </p><br>
		<p>I finally downloaded and copied the styling from This Week's Code at the botton of the unit 3 <a href="https://circuits.generalassemb.ly/student/426/lectures/1334">lecture</a>. And now I really have to move on. :)</p><br>
		
		<h4>About the Salon</h4>	
		<p>Soon Beauty Lab now offers three locations, where creativity and artistic expression are coupled with precision haircutting.
		<p>
		Our stylists are experts at listening. We synthesize your concerns with our own creativity and technical skill to produce great results.</p>
		<p>
		What you wonâ€™t find is the usual intimidation, boorish pretense and impersonality. The staff at Soon invite you to visit at one of their friendly neighborhood salons in: </p>
